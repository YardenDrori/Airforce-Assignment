## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Clone or manually download the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/YardenDrori/Airforce-Assignment.git
cd Airforce-Assignment
```
### 2. Set up the backend
```
cd monitor-backend
node server.js
```
The backend runs on ```http://localhost:8080```
Make sure MongoDB is running locally at ```mongodb://localhost:27017/FlightData``` (default for mongodb local)
If error message is shown in the server terminal then it is very likely that mongodb is either not installed or not running so double check!!!
### 3. Set up the frontend
```
cd monitor-frontend
npm start
```
The frontend runs on ```http://localhost:3000```

## ‚ö†Ô∏èRequirements / Dependencies

2) mongodb should be installed and running **locally** at ```mongodb://localhost:27017/FlightData``` which is the default local host adress for mongodb.

note: intended to run in chrome or chromium based web browsers
